This is my first project: a simulator for epidemies!

The "Epidemiological Simulator" is a Java program designed to simulate the spread of infectious diseases within different populations. This interactive and educational tool allows users to explore various scenarios and strategies for managing epidemics. Whether you're interested in modeling the dynamics of a well-known virus like COVID-19 or creating custom scenarios with different parameters, this program offers a flexible platform for experimentation.

Key Features:

- Educational Tool: This program serves has been an educational tool for understanding and applying in real world scenarios OOP concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

- Population and Virus Customization: Users can choose from default state and virus settings or input their own data. Customize the population size, available resources, test costs, and daily contact rates for each state. Define the infectivity, symptomaticity, lethality, and duration for different viruses.

- Terminal-Based Interface: While lacking a graphical user interface, the simulator provides a command-line interface for observing the progression of the virus. Users can make daily decisions regarding isolation, testing, and advancing to the next day.

- Isolation Strategies: Implement isolation measures to reduce the number of daily contacts for individuals. Decide how many people to isolate or release from isolation, influencing the disease's spread.

- Testing and Resource Management: Conduct tests to identify new cases and allocate resources wisely. Testing reduces available resources and reveals additional infections. Users must manage resources effectively to control the epidemic.

- Win or Lose Conditions: The simulator includes win and lose conditions. If the number of infected and symptomatic cases reaches zero, and the population isn't entirely extinct, you win. Beware of bankruptcy or the complete extinction of humanity, which results in defeat.

- Flexible and Customizable: Experiment with different scenarios, virus characteristics, and state settings to gain insights into disease control strategies. The simulator offers a flexible platform for exploring "what-if" scenarios.

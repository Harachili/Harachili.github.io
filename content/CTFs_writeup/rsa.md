e^2 divides both (p-1) and (q-1): [rsa1](rsa1)  
Common factor k in generating p, q: [rsa2](rsa2)  
q is the bitflip of p + brute-force of e: [rsa3](rsa3)  
Simple oracle that decrypts whatever != flag: [rsa4](rsa4)  
Leak of (p-2)\*(q-1) and of (p-1)\*(q-2): [rsa5](rsa5)  
Find n having phi, with p = 2\*q + 1: [rsa6](rsa6)

This is [me](about)

## Passions

Above all the things I'm most passionate about, ethical hacking is by far the one that never bores me to study (and practicing!) 

To keep learning about how to exploit vulnerabilities, with best practices, I started solving regularly CTFs, particularly crypto challenges are what entertains me the most, even though I try to solve also web challenges (btw, I should really start doing binary exploitation :) ).

Here I'm going to put writeups for the challenges I solve that I enjoyed the most working on: [CTFs\_writeup](ctfs_writeup)


## Projects

I'll also link here the projects on which I work, either personal ones or for university: [Projects](projects)
